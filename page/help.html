<h1>Necklace Map</h1>
<p>
  The Necklace Map library implements the algorithmic geo-visualization method
  by the same name, developed by Bettina Speckmann and Kevin Verbeek at TU
  Eindhoven (DOI: 10.1109/TVCG.2010.180 & 10.1142/S021819591550003X).

</div>
<p>
  This algorithm places a circular 'bead' on a curve around the map for each
  region of interest. The relative area of the beads is related to the relative
  size of a data value associated with each bead. The placement of the beads on
  the curve tries to keep each bead close to their region and thereby make the
  association between bead and region clear.
</p>
<p>
  There remains a large space for variation in bead size and placement within
  these limitations. This website provides several parameters that can be
  adjusted to tune the Necklace Map. The open source code library underlying
  this website provides even more such parameters. A description of each
  parameter on the website and their effect is descibed after a description on
  the format in which to provide input to the algorithm.
</p>

<h2>Input Format</h2>
<p>
  The Necklace Map requires two separate files to provide the input. The first
  file defines the geometry of the map. The second file defines one or more
  collections of data values per region. Several sets of example files are
  provided [insert link].
</p>
<h3>Input Geometry</h3>
<p>
  The geometry file must be an SVG file (mime type text/xml or image/svg+xml).
  In addition to the normal attributes, the svg element must define a 'bounds'
  attribute that defines the geographic position of the view box. For example, a
  svg could define viewBox="0 0 952 696" and
  bounds="[[482.4,259.3],[533.6,325.8]]". The viewbox specifies the part of the
  geometry to show (in pixel coordinates), the bounds specify the part of the
  world that this viewbox covers.
</p>
<p>
  The inner elements define the map regions and the necklace curve. These map
  region and necklace curve elements are identified by having a 'necklace_id'
  attribute. Any elements in the file that do not have a 'necklace_id' attribute
  are ignored, e.g. these elements will not be represented in the necklace map.
</p>
<p>
  Each region must be defined in one or more path elements. All path elements of
  a single region on the map must share the same 'region_id' attribute and this
  attribute will be written in the output bead associated with that region. The
  'region_id' is not allowed to be an empty strng (""). Note that it is not
  strictly required for the different paths associated with the same region to
  be defined near each other.
</p>
<p>
  Each region can be assigned a bead on a necklace in the output. The necklace
  map can have multiple necklaces and the necklace to use is determined by the
  'necklace_id' attribute of the path elements. Region elements with empty
  'necklace_id' are allowed, but these will not be given a bead on a necklace.
  They will be colored white in the necklace map output to indicate that they
  provide context to the map.
</p>

    alt="Necklace Map of a selection of states of the USA."
    width="750"
    height="483"
  />
</div>
<p>
  The region may have any style normally allowed for an svg element. The output
  regions and their associated bead are given the same style as the input. In
  case of a region spread over several paths, the output is assigned the style
  encountered last. Note that for clarity it is best to give all these paths the
  same style regardless.
</p>
<p>
  Each region path must be a polygon that starts from an absolute position. In
  other words, the first path command must be 'M'. These polygons are required
  to adhere to three rules. Firstly, the polygon must be closed using the 'Z' or
  'z' command. Polygons that are not closed will be ignored by the algorithm. It
  is not allowed to use a move command while the polygon is not closed.
  Secondly, degenerate lines (length 0) are not allowed. This includes the
  closing segment, i.e. the last point before closing cannot be the same as the
  starting point. Finally, the polygon is not allowed to self-intersect.
</p>
<p>
  A region that covers exactly one point is called a 'point region'. Such a
  region may be ignored by the necklace map, depending on the parameter
  settings.
</p>
<p>
  An inner elements can also define a necklace. A necklace element must either
  be a circle element or a Bezier spline defined in a path element. In either
  case, the element must define a unique 'necklace_id' attribute to detemine
  which regions should get a bead on the necklace. To distinguish necklaces from
  regions, a necklace cannot define a 'region_id' attribute.
</p>
<p>
  In case of a Bezier spline necklace, the path element must start with an
  absolute move command ('M') and it must be closed ('Z' or 'z'). The spline may
  contain lines, quadratic Bezier curves, and cubic Bezier curves. These curves
  must describe a closed curve, meaning that each next curve must start where
  the previous ended. The spline is not required to be smooth (e.g. there may be
  sharp corners between consecutive curves). However, smooth splines generally
  produce a better looking necklace map.

  />
</div>
<p>
  Similar to region elements, the necklace can have any style normally allowed
  for an svg element. Unlike the region elements, the necklace style used in the
  output does not mimic the input. Instead the output necklace will always be a
  black curve.
</p>
<p>
  The necklace map algorithm requires a 'kernel' per necklace that has clear
  vision to the complete necklace curve. In case of a circle element, the center
  is used as kernel. In case of a Bezier spline element, the kernel must be
  defined explicitly by 'kx' and 'ky' attributes. This kernel must be positioned
  such that it has 'clear vision' on the complete necklace, meaning that any ray
  originating from the kernel intersects the necklace in exactly one point.
</p>
<p>
  In theory, the necklace map algorithm works for any Bezier spline necklace
  that is completely visible from its kernel. However, in practice, splines that
  deviate far from a circular shape or kernels that are positioned near the
  necklace may result in a 'bad' necklace map. Normally, the necklace map
  algorithm tries to make the beads as large as possible to fill as much of the
  necklace as possible. Extreme spline shapes or kernel positions may leave
  large parts of the necklace empty. In the ideal case, the shape of the
  necklace approximates the arrangement of the regions of interest around the
  kernel. You may be able to adjust the input necklace to improve the output.
</p>
<h3>Input Values</h3>
<p>
  The data value file must be a plain text file (mime type text/plain)
  containing a 'header', the data element names, and a 'body' of small blocks of
  data per region of interest. All values should be separated by whitespace,
  e.g. spaces, tabs, or newlines. In case of character string variables such as
  names, double quotation marks ("") can be used to indicate a multi-word
  string.
</p>
<p>
  The header starts with a number defining the number of regions described in
  the file. This number must match the number of data blocks in the body. The
  next word in the header defines the type of data per region of interest. Each
  character in this word must be either 's' (character string type), 'd' (exact
  number type), or 'i' (natural number type). For example, the word 'ssddis'
  indicates that per region, we will give two string values, followed by two
  exact numbers, followed by a natural number, and finally another string value.
  The data value to visualize in the necklace map must be an exact number type
  (e.g. percentage of literate citizens) or a natural number type (e.g. number
  of immigrants).
</p>
<p>
  The data element names defines the data value names associated with the data
  types. Each of these must be a single word or it must be flanked by double
  quotation marks (""). There must be the same number of names as there are data
  types defined (see the header above). Exactly one of the names must be "ID"
  (note the capitalization). This ID value is used to cross reference the data
  values with the region geometry.
</p>
<p>
  The body has a block of data per region. Each such block must have a number of
  values of the types defined in the header. Note that string values may have
  multi-word values framed by double quotes (""). The data file may contain ID's
  that do not have a region in the geometry. This data has no effect on the
  necklace map. Similarly, the data file may contain 0 values for some regions
  defined in the geometry file, or some region defined in the geometry file may
  not even have a block of data in the body. Regions without a value or with a
  value of 0 will be colored light gray in the necklace map.
</p>
<p>
  A common mistake is to forget one value in some block in the body. In this
  case, the file parser will not be able to read the data correctly and no
  necklace map is shown. In this case, it may be helpful to tabulate the data
  file and check that the number of data blocks and the number of data values
  per block is correct.
</p>

<h2>Parameters</h2>
<h3>Data Value</h3>
<p>
  After loading the input files, the data value selecter should list the value
  names encountered in the data file. The 'ID' and 'name' value names are not
  listed, because they are assumed never to indicate data values. This selection
  determines which values are visualized in the necklace map. Note that regions
  in the input geometry without a value or with a 0 value will be colored light
  gray in the necklace map.
</p>
<h3>Ignore Point Regions</h3>
<p>
  This box may be checked ignore point regions. If the geometry does not contain
  point regions, this checkbox has no effect.

    alt="Necklace Map of a selection of European countries."
    width="500"
    height="471"
  />
</div>
<h3>Interval Type</h3>
<p>
  The interval type determines the feasible intervals, i.e. where each bead can
  be placed on the necklace. Centroid intervals are fixed width and their center
  is on the line through the necklace kernel and the centroid of the bead's
  regions.
</p>
<p>
  Wedge intervals are the part of the necklace inside the smallest wedge with
  the necklace kernel as apex that contains the bead's regions. Point regions
  and regions containing the necklace kernel get a centroid interval instead.
</p>
<h3>Order Type</h3>
<p>
  The order type determines whether the ordering of the beads on the necklace
  may be changed to increase the scale factor. This determines which scale
  factor computation algorithm will be used. For the fixed order type, the beads
  will be ordered on the necklace based on the clockwise extreme of their
  feasible interval. This reduces the complexity of the scale factor
  computations, which may reduce the computation time. For the variable order
  type, the beads can be arbitrarily reordered if this increases the scale
  factor. Note that the bead placement is still restricted by their feasible
  intervals. While this may greatly increase the scale factor, this generally
  also increases computation time.
</p>
<h3>Buffer</h3>
<p>
  The buffer is the angle (in radians) that must be empty between two
  neighboring beads. A larger scale factor generally makes it easier to see the
  differences in data value expressed by the necklace beads. However, larger
  beads may also severly clutter the map. The buffer parameter may be used to
  reduce this clutter by making the beads more distinct. Note that the buffer
  slider translates to the buffer value using a fourth degree function. this
  improves resolution for small values while allowing a wide range of values.
</p>
<p>
  For maps with multiple necklaces, the scale factor computation does not
  restrict overlap of beads on different necklaces. The buffer slider may be
  used to manually reduce this overlap.
</p>
<h3>Aversion</h3>
<p>
  The optimal scale factor is often limited by a small subset of the necklace
  beads that cannot be increased in size. These beads must be placed at very
  specific locations to stain inside their feasible intervals. The other beads
  have a subset of their feasible interval where they can be placed without
  overlap. The aversion value determines the final placement of these less
  restricted beads.
</p>
<p>
  The aversion slider ranges from close to 0 to 1. Lower aversion pulls the
  beads towards the center of their feasible interval. Higher aversion pushes
  the beads away from their neighbors. Similar to the buffer slider, the
  aversion slider translates to the aversion value using a fourth degree
  function. The lower aversion values generally have a larger impact on the
  final placement, so the slider has more resolution in this range.
</p>
<p>
  For maps with multiple necklaces, the scale factor computation does not
  restrict overlap of beads on different necklaces. The aversion slider may be
  used to manually reduce this overlap.
</p>
<h3>Centroid Interval Length</h3>
<p>
  The length (in radians) of the centroid intervals. This also applies to
  regions that are assigned a centroid interval when otherwise using wedge
  intervals, e.g. point regions and regions containing the necklace kernel.
</p>
<h3>Wedge Interval Minimum</h3>
<p>
  The minimum length (in radians) of the wedge intervals. This does not apply to
  regions that are assigned a centroid interval when otherwise using wedge
  intervals, e.g. point regions and regions containing the necklace kernel.
</p>
<h3>Bead ID Size</h3>
<p>
  The height (in pixels) of the bead IDs.
</p>

<h2>Output</h2>
<p>
  The necklace map output geometry is generated as an svg element. This element
  is displayed in the website. It is also stored in the Output text field so you
  can inspect or copy it. The Copy to Clipboard button can be used to
  conveniently copy this text to your clipboard. This way, you can store it
  locally in a .xml or .svg file.
</p>
<p>
  The website does not provide functionality to change the output. However, once
  copied to a local file, you could change any aspect of the output to fit your
  needs. For example, you could change the drawing style of the regions (e.g.
  colors, opacity, or border thickness), remove (a part of) the necklace curve,
  or add a base map underneath.
