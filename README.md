# Example minimal website with map and C++ backend.

This website is meant to be a minimal starting point for deploying a C++ back-end that generates data to be shown on a geographical map.

This website has been developed with design principles to promote responsiveness and good mobile usability:

- Mobile-first stylesheets.
- Minimize 'clutter'; maximize 'content'.
- Show something soon; indicate more is coming.
- Minimize reloading heavy content.
