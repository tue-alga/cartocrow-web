# CartoCrow web frontend

This repository contains the PHP web frontend of [CartoCrow](https://github.com/tue-alga/cartocrow), a framework for algorithms in cartographic visualization.

> :warning: CartoCrow is still a **work in progress**  and should not be considered stable yet. In particular, the web frontend currently does not work with the newest version of CartoCrow. This will be fixed in the near future.
